    <p class="about">
      I am not a designer before- after I graduated college. I even forgot that
      arts and the creative side is my strength. That there is where I can say I
      excel even when I was still young. I almost forgot because I juggled
      school with work when I was in college. I have to be at work in the
      morning and be at school in the evening. Adobe apps aren't my friends back
      then. I can say I don't have the time to really practice.

    <p class="about">
      After college, aside from my day job, I started accepting creating event
      invitations from people I know. And that is where it all started. I have
      to know how to edit and do layouts with photoshop. I noticed that although
      there are a lot of revisions from them, I can say that I enjoy what I do.
      And they liked it. People around me tell me why don't I apply as a
      designer if this is what I really want to to. I always say I want to but I
      think my skills aren't enough. It took me three years before deciding- to
      have the courage to make a leap from being a software QA to being a
      designer. I asked for clients to design for them pro bono for my
      portfolio. I am so glad I followed what they are telling me. Haha. I
      finally had the job that I enjoy doing.

    <p class="about">
      I am still studying. I want to know more about UX and the research aside
      from just the mere putting myself in the feet of the users- the User
      Experience almost everybody know. I can't wait to learn more as a UI/UX
      designer and share more of it to you very soon.
